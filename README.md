## 🛠️ Requirements

Before installing OmniView, ensure you have the following:

* Conky: The lightweight system monitor itself.
* Conky Manager (Recommended): For easy management and enabling/disabling widgets.
* NVIDIA Proprietary Driver: For full GPU monitoring (as noted above).
* nvidia-smi and nvidia-settings: These tools are part of the NVIDIA driver package and are essential for extracting GPU data.

Note: GPU information requires the proprietary NVIDIA driver. Values will display as N/A if using the open-source nouveau driver.

## ⬇️ Installation Guide

The commands below are for Ubuntu-based distributions.  
For other distros and advanced installation options, it is recommended to visit the official [Conky GitHub repository](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky).

### 1. Install Conky and Conky Manager (if you haven't already)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install conky-all conky-manager
```

### 2. Download the latest version of OmniView

Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/ixWatan/OmniView/releases) section and download the latest `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archive. Extract it to your Conky directory (usually `~/.conky/`).

### 3. Launch Conky Manager

Open Conky Manager, enable **OmniView**, and customize it to your liking — such as position, background color, and transparency.
